								<b>On Safe and Usable Chatbots for Promoting Voter Participation</b>.
								<br><b>Summary:</b>
								<br>We created chatbots to help increase voting among seniors 
								and first-time voters by giving them easy access to trusted election information tailored 
								to their needs. Our system, built on the Rasa platform, ensures the information is reliable 
								and allows for quick chatbot setup for any region. We've tested these chatbots in two 
								US states where voting has been difficult, focusing on groups of senior citizens. 
								This project aims to support voters and democracy by making accurate election information more accessible.

								<b>Explainable Pathfinding for Inscrutable Planners with Inductive Logic Programming</b>
								<br><b>Summary:</b>
								<br>By combining inductive logic programming (ILP) with a given inscrutable planner, we constructed an explainable graph representing solutions to all states in the state space. 
								This graph can then be summarized using a variety of methods such as hierarchical representations or simple if/else rules. 
								We tested our approach on Towers of Hanoi.

								<b>Solving the Rubik’s Cube with a PDDL Planner.</b>
								<br><b>Summary:</b>
								<br>We introduced a new way to solve the 3D Rubik's Cube using a special planning language and tested it with a known planner, 
								making it a tough challenge at the International Planning Competition 2023. We also made a tool that shows how the solution works. 
								This helps both experts looking to improve solving methods and beginners wanting to learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube by 
								trying out and seeing different solving steps.
